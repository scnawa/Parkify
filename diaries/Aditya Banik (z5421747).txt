Week 1: 
During the initial week, a team of six individuals was assembled, and we reached a consensus to develop the Car Space Rental Management System. 
Roles were designated for both backend and frontend teams, along with the selection of programming languages for each aspect - Python for the backend and React JS for the frontend. 
The project owner was identified as Sarvesh, with Ridhvik appointed as the Scrum Master. I was appointed as a Backend Developer


Week 2: 

During the second week, our attention shifted towards crafting the Proposal. 
We divided the tasks among ourselves. I handled the introduction and the Scrum section, Sinha tackled the software architecture section, while Sam, Batu and I were assigned to create storyboards for the user stories. 
Ridhvik took charge of the Scrum section. Nearly everyone contributed to formatting the report. We opted to collaborate using Microsoft Word for compiling the report.

Week 3: 
During the third week, our focus shifted towards achieving our goal for sprint 1. 
We reviewed several user stories intended for the initial sprint. While we were initially content with those centered around user authentication, 
feedback from tutors led us to realize that our target was too narrow. 
Consequently, we expanded our scope to encompass user stories concerning providers' ability to upload and update their listings, in addition to the authentication aspect.

Week 4: 

We began our journey towards sprint one by diving into coding. 
Despite a slightly delayed start compared to other teams, by the end of the week, we had caught up and were on track with our sprint one goals. 
Within a day, I managed to complete all the backend functions for provider listings. 
Following that, I contributed to creating the get_listing functions and crafting API calls that the frontend will utilize. 
Additionally, I configured the MongoDB database. Sarvesh and I worked together on designing the database structure.

Week 5:

In week 5, our focus was on completing the backend functionalities related to user authentication and provider listing management. 
We finalized the implementation of user signup, login, logout, and account deletion functionalities. I worked on refining the error handling mechanisms and integrating Stripe API for payment processing. 
Additionally, I collaborated with Sarvesh to optimize database queries and ensure data integrity.

Week 6:

During the sixth week, we concentrated on enhancing the user experience by implementing features such as email verification during signup and password reset functionalities. 
I integrated helper functions for sending verification emails and resetting passwords securely. 
Furthermore, I worked on refining the listing management functionalities, including creating, updating, deactivating, and deleting listings. 
We conducted thorough testing to ensure the robustness and reliability of these features.

Week 7:

In week 7, we shifted our focus towards improving system performance and scalability. 
I optimized database queries and implemented caching mechanisms to reduce response times and enhance overall system efficiency. 
Additionally, I collaborated with the frontend team to integrate the backend APIs seamlessly into the user interface. 
We conducted stress testing to identify and address any bottlenecks or performance issues.

Week 8:

During the eighth week, we prioritized implementing additional user management functionalities, such as profile updates and password resets. 
I enhanced the backend logic for user profile management and integrated secure password hashing mechanisms to ensure data security. 
Moreover, I collaborated with the frontend team to implement dynamic user interfaces for profile editing and password reset functionalities.

Week 9:

In week 9, we focused on implementing booking management functionalities to enable users to create and manage bookings for parking spaces. 
I developed backend APIs for creating bookings, releasing bookings, and ending bookings based on user interactions. 
Additionally, I collaborated with the frontend team to design intuitive user interfaces for booking management, incorporating real-time updates and notifications.

Week 10:

During the tenth week, our efforts were directed towards implementing dispute resolution functionalities and refining the booking management system. 
I integrated backend logic for handling disputes between users and providers, including creating disputes, resolving disputes, and retrieving dispute details. 
Furthermore, I optimized the booking management system to ensure seamless communication between users and providers, enhancing the overall user experience.

Week 11:

In the final week of this period, we conducted comprehensive testing and debugging to address any remaining issues and ensure the stability and reliability of the system. 
I collaborated closely with the quality assurance team to identify and resolve any bugs or performance issues. 
Additionally, I documented the backend APIs and provided technical support to the deployment team during the system rollout. 
Finally, we conducted a retrospective to reflect on our achievements and identify areas for improvement in future sprints.
