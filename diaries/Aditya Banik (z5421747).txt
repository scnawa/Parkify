Week 1: 
During the initial week, a team of six individuals was assembled, and we reached a consensus to develop the Car Space Rental Management System. 
Roles were designated for both backend and frontend teams, along with the selection of programming languages for each aspect - Python for the backend and React JS for the frontend. 
The project owner was identified as Sarvesh, with Ridhvik appointed as the Scrum Master. I was appointed as a Backend Developer



Week 2: 

During the second week, our attention shifted towards crafting the Proposal. 
We divided the tasks among ourselves. I handled the introduction and the Scrum section, Sinha tackled the software architecture section, while Sam, Batu and I were assigned to create storyboards for the user stories. 
Ridhvik took charge of the Scrum section. Nearly everyone contributed to formatting the report. We opted to collaborate using Microsoft Word for compiling the report.

Week 3: 
During the third week, our focus shifted towards achieving our goal for sprint 1. 
We reviewed several user stories intended for the initial sprint. While we were initially content with those centered around user authentication, 
feedback from tutors led us to realize that our target was too narrow. 
Consequently, we expanded our scope to encompass user stories concerning providers' ability to upload and update their listings, in addition to the authentication aspect.

Week 4: 

We began our journey towards sprint one by diving into coding. 
Despite a slightly delayed start compared to other teams, by the end of the week, we had caught up and were on track with our sprint one goals. 
Within a day, I managed to complete all the backend functions for provider listings. 
Following that, I contributed to creating the get_listing functions and crafting API calls that the frontend will utilize. 
Additionally, I configured the MongoDB database. Sarvesh and I worked together on designing the database structure.
