Week 1: 
In the first week, we formed a team of six people and we decided on doing the Car Space Rental Management System. 
We decided on the backend and frontend teams and the language we would use for the respective ends. 
Backend is going to be on Python and Frontend on React JS. 
We decided on The Project Owner as Sarvesh (me) and the Scrum Master (Ridhvik) 


Week 2: 
The second week was more focused on writing the Proposal. 
We distributed the workload of the proposal between ourselves. 
I was doing the introduction and the Scrum section, Sinha was doing the software architecture section, Sam, Ady, and Batu 
were going to do the Storyboards for the user stories and Ridhvik was going to do the Scrum section. 
Almost everyone was involved in formatting the report. 
We decided to use Microsoft Word collaborate to make the report. 

Week 3: 
In the third week, we started thinking about reaching our target for sprint 1. 
We vetted out some user stories for the first sprint; Initially, we were satisfied with the user stories 
relating to user authentication but upon insight from tutors, we found out that it was too small a target 
so we included user stories from the requirement of provider being able to upload their listing and updating their listing. 

Week 4: 
We were starting to code our way to sprint one. Although we have started a bit later compared to other teams,
we were pretty much at par with our target for sprint one towards the end of the week. 
I completed all of the user authentication backend functions in a day and then helped in create listing function 
and wrote API calls on which the frontend will request from and then set up the database on MongoDB. 
Ady collaborated with me in designing the database.
