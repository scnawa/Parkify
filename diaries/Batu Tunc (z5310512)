Week 1: 
In the first week we decided to do project 7, car space rental management system. We discussed the task breifly and allocated the project owner was identified to Sarvesh and Ridhvik appointed as the Scrum Master. I was made to be a frontend dev on this project. 

Week 2: 
We slowly made the proposal. The user stories were put onto jira. I personally did the story board for the admin role, taking in the user stories from jira to create a storyboard which encompassed that all.

Week 3: 
We thought about the sprint 1 user stories and decided to add in other funtionalites such as creating/editing/upload listings and other stuff into it as we felt the initial load was too little.

Week 4: 
We started working on the project codebase, with half and half split of the team to focus on the frontend and backend. I worked on the frontend, specifically the admin page, live listings page, login page, signup page, verficiation page, and did some general oversight of the entire site. At this point, the frontend was done without the backend as we did not connect it yet. Hence this week was more about design of the pages rather than functionality.
